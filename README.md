## Business Understanding

### Problem Statement
The primary objective is to predict the monthly revenue of a restaurant. Accurate forecasting helps in efficient decision-making related to operations and marketing.

## Data Understanding

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved:
- Descriptive statistics
- Visualization of data distributions
- Identification of missing values and outliers

## Data Preparation

### Steps Taken
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation techniques for missing data.
2. **Correcting Data Types**: Ensuring correct data types for all variables.
3. **Addressing Outliers**: Using z-score analysis and IQR.
4. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Creating new features and selecting important ones using variance and correlation thresholds.
5. **Normalization**: Scaling numerical features.

## Model Building

### Models Developed
1. **Deep Learning Model (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**
2. **XGBoost Regressor**

### Model Selection
The MLP neural network model outperformed the XGBoost regressor and was selected for final predictions.

## Evaluation

### Performance Metrics
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: 0.67
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 44
- **Error Percentage**: 35%

The MLP model showed good performance with minimal overfitting.

## Conclusion
The MLP neural network model provides reliable revenue predictions, enabling effective decision-making for restaurant management.

## Future Work
- Additional feature engineering (e.g., incorporating external factors)
- Exploring advanced time-series forecasting techniques
- Using ensemble methods for improved performance
